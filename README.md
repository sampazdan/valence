# Valence - Quantum Computing Made Simple(r)

Learning quantum computing is hard enough as is.

Learning a complex library only makes it worse.

Valence is (will be) simple, lightweight, and beginner-friendly.

Welcome to the quantum world!


## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and run tests
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
ctest
```
